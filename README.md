# BeerPedia - Android Application

## Description
BeerPedia is an Android application developed in Kotlin that utilizes various Jetpack Android libraries to display information about different types of beer. The app connects to the [Punk API](https://api.punkapi.com/v2/), providing data on beer types and their ingredients.

The app Implements the [Paging Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview) helps you load and display pages of data from a larger dataset, in this case the list is paginated and shows a maximum of 25 items at a time.

**Note:** This project is actively maintained, and I plan to gradually incorporate new functionalities and libraries to explore and test exciting features.
